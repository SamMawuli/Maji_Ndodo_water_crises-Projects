# Maji_Ndodo_water_crises-Projects
The Maji Ndogo Project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at ensuring the sustainability and quality of water resources in underdeveloped regions. The project employs data-driven methodologies to monitor, audit, and report on water quality, as well as the effectiveness of water services across various locations.

**Project Structure**

The project is divided into several phases, each focused on different aspects of data management and analysis:

Data Collection: Field teams gather water quality data from various locations. This data includes subjective quality scores and detailed observations from local residents.

Data Integration: The collected data is integrated into a central database, where it is organized and linked to relevant tables, such as locations, water sources, and employee assignments.

Audit and Verification: An independent audit is conducted to verify the integrity of the data. The audit focuses on cross-referencing field data with stored records to ensure accuracy and to detect any discrepancies.

Analysis and Reporting: Complex queries are developed to analyze the data, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies. Special attention is given to employee performance and the consistency of recorded water quality scores.

Actionable Insights: The project culminates in actionable recommendations based on the analysis, with the goal of improving water services and ensuring data accuracy.

**Key Features**

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Analysis: The project includes a detailed ERD analysis to understand the structure and relationships within the database, crucial for linking records accurately.

Error Detection and Correction: A significant focus is placed on detecting errors in data entry and correcting these to maintain high data integrity (identifying discrepancies between employee-recorded scores and auditor-verified scores.)

Employee Performance Monitoring: Tracks the performance of individual employees, identifying those who consistently make errors or exhibit suspicious patterns in data recording.

Corruption Detection: Advanced queries are used to detect potential corruption by analyzing patterns in employee mistakes and cross-referencing them with audits.

**Database Structure**

The core tables in the Maji Ndogo Project database include:

Visits Table: Logs all visits to water locations, including timestamps and employee assignments.
Water Quality Table: Stores water quality scores and related data.
Employee Table: Contains information about employees, including their assigned tasks and performance metrics.
Auditor Report Table: Houses the results of the independent audit, including re-evaluated water quality scores and any observations noted during the audit.
